## Demo/ (source files for demo applications)
#### There are some projects you might be interested in:

  - **InteractiveTVClient/** - thats a C# WPF application, that contains a browser control, that is preconfigured a bit (all the script unsafeness and other warnings are suppressed (silent activex), unless it naviagates to file on disk (as far as I understood there is no way to resolve that issue, just launch it from localhost)); on the start, application tries to connect to remote C++ gesture server (see InteractiveTVServer/) through TCP sockets, subscribes for swipe events, and starts receiving gesture events from server, and if the connection fails, it launches inline gesture server (see InteractiveTVServer/InteractiveTVInlineServer/), written on C#; when gesture event is received, applications invokes predefined scripts of the current site, and the site content changes); there are some 3rd party libraries, like WpfDialogManagment (not yet used - from codeproject), WpfPageTransition (required for animation - from codeproject) and dlls: FaceSDK.NET.dll (is required for face recognition, but this classes are not yet used, because target machine is a bit slowers then mine, and simultaneous processing for faces and gestures is too complex for it) and libpxcclr.dll (for inline gesture server - slower then Cpp server, but faster then Cpp server + chatting with TCP); actually, remote server is designed for distributed implementation of system, so that one machine works only with camera, processing images, recognizing gestures, faces and objects, and the other one - busy with some complex rendering on lange TV screen
  - **InteractiveTVServer/** - is not so interesting as client (see it above): it uses Libs/Recognizing library for tracking gestures, face and objects and Libs/App (Nena::App::Talk) to create server and accept client, subscribe them for gestures events, and send them gesture events when they fire (still needs to be optimized, uses CPU intensively)
  - **GestureWinemit/** - (1) - finds all top level windows, and writes the data to file [-print option + file], (2) - user should edit generated file, where he should leave only those windows, he wants to contol remotely, (3) - user launches application [-emit option + file], application then finds all the top levels windows, which has corresponding titles and class names (those parameters define a single window), and posts 'key down' events to their window threads directly - this was our first solution of how to control browser from C++ program, and it worked just fine and quick enough, later we found another solution for remote control (see InteractiveTVServer/ demo)
  - **SimpleSkin/, SimpleAnimation/** - shows how to use MayaReader and to load *.ma.xml files, then find meshes, transforms, clusters and curves you need, how to perform skinning on the CPU and then animate skeleton (resolving both approximate (for simple hermite curve segment - for baked animation curves - FBX SDK has such option when exporting) and exact curve values (requires finding solution for cubic equation fast) for any given time within the animation curve time range (out of bound attemps return the very left or right curve values))
  - **SmallTalk/** - the Microsoft Excel 2010 (or later) add-in, that shows, how to load data from .xls(x) file, how to use Excel API, use built-in functionality (resolve Students t-distribution values, Chi-squared distribution, Fisher distribution and others), how to perform Grubbs test for outliers, ANOVA (analysis of variance), check normalization hypothesis and normalize sample, how to resolve cental and raw moments and coefficients (variance, covariance, asymmetry, kurtosis, mean, std deviation and others), find coefficients for any polynomial regression and some advanced checks for linear model, correlation analysis; it also contains classes for integration, solving LES (gauss solver), generating combinations, and also a set of advanced math functions (ExtendedMath.cs) I took in the internet (but, didn`t used, because I found Excel API had everything I needed to complete labwork task); it also shows, how to add different kinds of charts with advanced styles to you excel document
  - **Extra/PolyAreaCalculation/, Extra/PolyPointIntersection** - line-line intersection, segment-segment intersection, polygon-point intersection
  - **Fire/, ShadowMapping/, SoftShadowMapping/** - basically, those projects are Rastertek tutorials, implemented using my classes (SoftShadowMapping uses compute shaders with cached and separable gaussians for blurring render target)
  - **SimpleLight/, SpecularLight/** - simple NdotL lighting algorithms implemented
  - **SimpleRaycast/** - finds out whether camera ray intersects a sphere in the scene
  - **SimpleText/** - Direct2D (DirectWrite actually) interoperation with Direct3D sample
  - **Isoclus/** - ISOCLUS clusterization algorithm, implemented with C#
  - **Pathfinding/** - implements A* and D* pathfinding algoritms (one project has two algorithms implemented)
  - **MayaWriter/** - parses *.ma files to *.ma.xml to xml format, that can be imported with MayaReader (see Lib/MayaReader)
  - **Projectiles/** - simulates projectiles trajectories with initial simulation parameters defined
  - **Satellites/** - simulates satellites trajectories in space
  - **Puzzles/** - heuristic solver for 3x3 puzzle game
  - **Speech2Text/, Text2Speech/** - using windows api (one should have just ideal pronunciation)
