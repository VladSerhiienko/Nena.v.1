IT INT RODUCED A RADICALLY NEW METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, WHICH 
WENT FAR TOWARD SOLVING ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY, KEY DIS
TRIBUTI ON, AND HAS BECOME KNOWN AS DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE. THE ARTICLE ALS
O STIMUL
ATED THE ALMOST IMMEDIATE PUBLIC DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF ENCIPHERING ALGOR
ITHMS, THE ASYMMETRIC KEY ALGORITHMS. PRIOR TO THAT TIME, ALL USEFUL MODERN ENCR
YPTION ALGORITHMS HAD BEEN SYMMETRIC KEY ALGORITHMS, IN WHICH THE SAME CRYPTOGRA
PHIC KEY IS USED WITH THE UNDERLYING ALGORITHM BY BOTH THE SENDER AND THE RECIPI
ENT, WHO MUST BOTH KEEP IT SECRET. ALL OF THE ELECTROMECHANICAL MACHINES USED IN
 WWII WERE OF THIS LOGICAL CLASS, AS WERE THE CAESAR AND ATBASH CIPHERS AND ESSE
NTIALLY ALL CIPHER SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT HISTORY. THE 'KEY' FOR A CODE IS, OF COURS
E, THE CODEBOOK, WHICH MUST LIKEWISE BE DISTRIBUTED AND KEPT SECRET, AND SO SHAR
ES MOST OF THE SAME PROBLEMS IN PRACTICE. OF NECESSITY, THE KEY IN EVERY SUCH SY
STEM HAD TO BE EXCHANGED BETWEEN THE COMMUNICATING PARTIES IN SOME SECURE WAY PR
IOR TO ANY USE OF THE SYSTEM THE TERM USUALLY USED IS 'VIA A SECURE CHANNEL' SUC
H AS A TRUSTWORTHY COURIER WITH A BRIEFCASE HANDCUFFED TO A WRIST, OR FACE-TO-FA
CE CONTACT, OR A LOYAL CARRIER PIGEON. THIS REQUIREMENT IS NEVER TRIVIAL AND VER
Y RAPIDLY BECOMES UNMANAGEABLE AS THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS INCREASES, OR WHEN 
SECURE CHANNELS AREN'T AVAILABLE FOR KEY EXCHANGE, OR WHEN, AS IS SENSIBLE CRYPT
OGRAPHIC PRACTICE, KEYS ARE FREQUENTLY CHANGED.THE AGING DES WAS OFFICIALLY REPL
ACED BY THE ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD AES IN
- WHEN NIST ANNOUNCED FIPS. AFTER AN OPEN COMPETITION, NIST SELECTED RIJNDAEL, S
UBMITTED BY TWO BELGIAN CRYPTOGRAPHERS, TO BE THE AES. DES, AND MORE SECURE VARI
ANTS OF IT SUCH AS TRIPLE DES, ARE STILL USED TODAY, HAVING BEEN INCORPORATED IN
TO MANY NATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL STANDARDS. HOWEVER, ITS X-BIT KEY-SIZE HAS B
EEN SHOWN TO BE INSUFFICIENT TO GUARD AGAINST BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS ONE SUCH ATTAC
K, UNDERTAKEN BY THE CYBER CIVIL-RIGHTS GROUP ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION IN-
, SUCCEEDED IN- HOURS. AS A RESULT, USE OF STRAIGHT DES ENCRYPTION IS NOW WITHOU
T DOUBT INSECURE FOR USE IN NEW CRYPTOSYSTEM DESIGNS, AND MESSAGES PROTECTED BY 
OLDER CRYPTOSYSTEMS USING DES, AND INDEED ALL MESSAGES SENT SINCE USING DES, ARE
 ALSO AT RISK. REGARDLESS OF DES' INHERENT QUALITY, THE DES KEY SIZE WAS THOUGHT
 TO BE TOO SMALL BY SOME EVEN IN-, PERHAPS MOST PUBLICLY BY WHITFIELD DIFFIE. TH
ERE WAS SUSPICION THAT GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS EVEN THEN HAD SUFFICIENT COMPUTI
NG POWER TO BREAK DES MESSAGES; CLEARLY OTHERS HAVE ACHIEVED THIS CAPABILITY.THE
 SECOND DEVELOPMENT, IN-, WAS PERHAPS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT, FOR IT FUNDAMENTALLY 
CHANGED THE WAY CRYPTOSYSTEMS MIGHT WORK. THIS WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE PAPER 
NEW DIRECTIONS IN CRYPTOGRAPHY BY WHITFIELD DIFFIE AND MARTIN HELLMAN. IT INTROD
UCED A RADICALLY NEW METHOD OF DISTRIBUTING CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEYS, WHICH WENT FAR T
OWARD SOLVING ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS OF CRYPTOGRAPHY, KEY DISTRIBUTION,
 AND HAS BECOME KNOWN AS DIFFIE-HELLMAN KEY EXCHANGE.
HE MID-S SAW TWO MAJOR PUBLIC ADVANCES. FIRST WAS THE PUBLICATION OF THE DRAFT 
DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD IN THE U.S. FEDERAL REGISTER ON MARCH. THE PROPOSED DES
 CIPHER WAS SUBMITTED BY A RESEARCH GROUP AT IBM, AT THE INVITATION OF THE NATIO
NAL BUREAU OF STANDARDS NOW NIST, IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP SECURE ELECTRONIC COMM
UNICATION FACILITIES FOR BUSINESSES SUCH AS BANKS AND OTHER LARGE FINANCIAL ORGA
NIZATIONS. AFTER 'ADVICE' AND MODIFICATION BY NSA, ACTING BEHIND THE SCENES, IT 
WAS ADOPTED AND PUBLISHED AS A FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARD PUBLICATI
ON IN-. DES WAS THE FIRST PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CIPHER TO BE 'BLESSED' BY A NATION
AL AGENCY SUCH AS NSA. THE RELEASE OF ITS SPECIFICATION BY NBS STIMULATED AN EXP
LOSION OF PUBLIC AND ACADEMIC INTEREST IN CRYPTOGRAPHY. THE AGING DES WAS OFFICI
ALLY REPLACED BY THE ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD AES IN- WHEN NIST ANNOUNCED FI
