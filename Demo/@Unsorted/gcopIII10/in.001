# Frequency distribution control mode - FIXED (0) or ADAPTIVE (1)
# If the frequency is given as ADAPTIVE, the frequency of each operator
# is dynamically adjusted according to its success or failure in each
# application; In that case, the lower and upper limits of the frequency
# are determined by L_FREQ_LIM and U_FREQ_LIM in the GENOCOP.H header
# file; so, for ADAPTIVE operator frequency, the frequency of operators
# can be ignored.  The frequency data is written into FREQ.DAT 
# WARNING!!! This file can get quite large, since the frequency
# distribution is recorded every time an operator fails/succeeds.

# Now, the frequency of operators.  We suggest they be uniform values to
# start with.  The number of operators has been provided above.
# At present, the order of operators are :
#
# 1.  Whole arithmetical crossover
# 2.  Simple arithmetical crossover
# 3.  Whole uniform mutation
# 4.  Boundary mutation
# 5.  Non-uniform mutation
# 6.  Whole non-uniform mutation
# 7.  Heuristic crossover
# 8.  Gaussian mutation
# 9.  Pool recombination operator
# 10. Scatter search operator
